# Password Policy Discovery

**ATT\&CK ID:** [T1201](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1201/)

**Permissions Required:** <mark style="color:orange;">**Various**</mark>

**Description**

Adversaries may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network or cloud environment. Password policies are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through Brute Force. This information may help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).

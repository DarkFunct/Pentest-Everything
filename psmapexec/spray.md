# Spray

The spray module provides different password spraying techniques. PsMapExec takes into account the default domain policy's account lockout threshold to prevent user account lockouts. However, it does not consider fine-grained password policies. It's advisable to assess whether such policies are in place within the environment to avoid potentially locking out a significant number of user accounts.

# Target Acquisition

Target acuisition through PsMapExec relies on the use of PowerView which most be called externally from the script. This will likely change in the future to instead support the native Active Directory PowerShell module in order to help evade Anti-virus solutions.

IP Address specification and targets from file are currently unsupported but in development.

Currently, the script points to Github to pull the dev version of PowerView.

By default only enabled Active Directory computer accounts are populated into the target list.

### Syntax

```
PsMapExec -Targets [Targets]
```

The following parameters are supported for `-Targets`&#x20;

```powershell
# Grabs all workstations, servers and domain controllers within the domain
PsMapExec -Targets All

# Grabs only servers from the domain
PsMapExec -Targets Servers

# Grabs only Domain Controllers from the domain
PsMapExec -Targets DCs

# Grabs only workstations from the domain
PsMapExec -Targets Workstations

# Set the target values to a defined computer name
PsMapExec -Targets DC01.Security.local
```

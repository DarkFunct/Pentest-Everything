# Cross Domain Usage

PsMapExec has the ability to impersonate users on one domain to access resources on a different domain.&#x20;

When accessing resources across domain and impersonating a user we need two parameters:

* UserDomain: The domain of the user we are impersonating
* Domain: The target domain where we intended to access resources

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
PsMapExec -Targets All -Domain child.security.local -UserDomain security.local -username Moe -Password Password -method [Method] -Command [Command]
```
{% endcode %}

In the command example shown above we are getting all computers in the domain child.security.local and impersonating the user Moe whose account resides in the security.local domain.&#x20;

As security.local is a parent to the child domain child.security.local there is a trust between them and the user moe can access resources in the child domain.
